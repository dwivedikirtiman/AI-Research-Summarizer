Ok, so before clonning or downloading the project some information you should need to know..

> The folder named "research-assistant" is basicaly a spring boot project which are initialized from spring 
  boot initilizer and being created as a backend application where i've consumed the GEMINI API and created 
  multiple java files for working of this backend application.

> The second folder name "Research-Assistant-EXT" is basicaly a extension which is particularly created for
  google chrome and this folder contains four necessary files in which manifest.json is a most important file.

> For creating the backend app you need to have open the "research-assistant" folder in IntelliJ IDE or any of 
  your prefer IDE and build the maven app with all the required dependencies also for testing the API Key of GEMINI
  you can use POSTMAN.

> For the extension open the second folder i.e "Research-Assistant-EXT" in VS code or any prefered IDE and visit the 
  chrome extension url (chrome://extensions/) and on the "Developer Mode" and click on "Load Unpacked" and select the 
  directory where this "Research-Assistant-EXT" is stored or you've saved.


> I've included the whole project_structure also in txt file named as "project_structure.txt".
  Not the info you should know but If you also want to include this kind of project_structure in txt format in vs code
  then simple open your project folder and open terminal in vs code and run the command " tree /f /a > project_structure.txt "
  This command will create a project_structure in txt file and it is for any kind of project.
